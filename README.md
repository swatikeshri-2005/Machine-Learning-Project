🎯 Project Overview

Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is widely used in digital advertising to estimate the probability that a user will click on an advertisement.
This project uses Machine Learning models to predict whether a user will click on an ad based on user behavior and ad attributes.

🚀 Features

✔ CTR prediction using machine learning
✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing
✔ Categorical feature encoding
✔ Multiple model comparison
✔ Performance evaluation
✔ Works seamlessly in Google Colab
